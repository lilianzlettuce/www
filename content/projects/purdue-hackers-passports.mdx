    #### Overview
    This project serves as the primary digital presence for Purdue Hackers, showcasing the organization's mission, events, and community. The site is designed to engage current members and attract new participants to the hacking community.

    <br/><br/><br/>

    #### Brief
    When I first joined the Purdue Hackers organizing team in my freshman year, the club's website was in dire need of an upgrade. As part of the engineering team, I was tasked with building a dynamic experience that reflected our club's core vision and values. 

    - Current site is out of date, need an updated site to reflect new branding and represent our online presence
    - Need a dedicated website to communicate what the club does and how interested individuals can get involved

    #### Pages
    We went for a Neobrutalist Retro UI aesthetic (High contrast, draggable windows, fun/unique graphics and interactions)
    - Hero 
    - Welcome email message (interactive email component)
    - Hack Night (previous events, secret windows, countdown)
    - CTA (custom graphics)

    <br/><br/><br/>

    #### Impact
    The landing page serves as a crucial touchpoint for the Purdue Hackers community, helping to grow membership and showcase the organization's impact on campus.

    <br/><br/><br/>

    #### Next steps
    - Club is constantly growing and evolving, website should change in stride to reflect club's identity
