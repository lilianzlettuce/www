# Becoming

An interactive audio-visual experience that bridges the gap between digital and physical interaction through custom hardware and environmental sensing.

## Overview

Becoming is a custom playable device that responds to both interaction through an analog interface, and audiovisual stimuli detected from the surrounding environment. This project explores the relationship between human interaction, environmental data, and artistic expression.

## Key Features

- **Custom Hardware Interface**: Analog controls for direct manipulation
- **Environmental Sensing**: Real-time detection of surrounding stimuli
- **Audio-Visual Response**: Dynamic feedback based on interaction and environment
- **Interactive Art**: Blends technology with artistic expression

## Technical Implementation

The project combines Arduino for hardware control and Processing for audio-visual output, creating a seamless bridge between physical interaction and digital response.

## Impact

This project has been selected for presentation at The International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME), highlighting its contribution to the field of interactive music and art.

## Future Development

- Enhanced environmental sensing capabilities
- Multi-user interaction support
- Integration with machine learning for adaptive responses
