    ###### Implementation
  </SectionColumn>
  <SectionColumn size={12}>
    #### Key Features
    - **Custom Hardware Interface**: Analog controls for direct manipulation
    - **Environmental Sensing**: Real-time detection of surrounding stimuli
    - **Audio-Visual Response**: Dynamic feedback based on interaction and environment
    - **Interactive Art**: Blends technology with artistic expression

    <br/><br/><br/>

    #### Technical Implementation
    The project combines Arduino for hardware control and Processing for audio-visual output, creating a seamless bridge between physical interaction and digital response.

    <br/><br/><br/>

    #### Impact
    This project has been selected for presentation at The International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME), highlighting its contribution to the field of interactive music and art.

    <br/><br/><br/>

    #### Future Development
    - Enhanced environmental sensing capabilities
    - Multi-user interaction support
    - Integration with machine learning for adaptive responses
