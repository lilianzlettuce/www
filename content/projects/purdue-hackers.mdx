    ### Brief
  </SectionColumn>
  <SectionColumn size={3}>
    #### Background (Context & Problem)
    When I first joined the Purdue Hackers organizing team in my freshman year, the club's website was in dire need of an upgrade.
    As part of the engineering team, I was tasked with building a dynamic experience that reflected our club's core vision and values. 

    - Current site is out of date, need an updated site to reflect new branding and represent our online presence
    - Need a dedicated website to communicate what the club does and how interested individuals can get involved

  <SectionColumn size={2}>
    ### Problem
  </SectionColumn>
  <SectionColumn size={3}>
    The current landing page featured the most up-to-date content about the company, but was built using stock graphics on a site-builder. 
    Conversely, the new UI prototypes provided by the designer did not entirely cover the most updated content.

    ### Goals
  </SectionColumn>
  <SectionColumn size={3}>
    → Build a new site landing page that reflects Scout’s playful visual identity while effectively communicating what the company does
    
    → Incorporate existing designs, taking creative liberties to implement new content in the same design language
    
    → Create new components, interactions, and assets that fit existing design language
    
    → Maintain visual cohesion

  ## Goals
  - Create an engaging and informative landing page to introduce Purdue Hackers to the public
  - Highlight the club's mission, past projects, and upcoming events
  - Provide a clear and user-friendly process for joining the club
  - Ensure the site is mobile-friendly and accessible to all users

  ## Constraints
  - The website must align with the club’s branding and visual identity
  -- (coherent branding and visual identity was kind of non-existent at this point, we were making it up as we go along)
  - Should be deployable using free or low-cost hosting services
  - Should be easy to maintain and update with new content
  - Ship by the end of school year (2 semesters time)

  ## Key Features

  - **Brand Identity**: Unique visual design capturing our identity as an organization
  - **Community Showcase**: Highlights member projects and achievements
  - **Event Information**: Centralized location for hackathon and workshop details
  - **Member Resources**: Access to tools, tutorials, and community guidelines
  - **Responsive Design**: Optimized for students accessing from various devices

  ## Technical Implementation

  Built with modern web technologies to ensure reliability and maintainability for a student-run organization.

  <TechStack 
    technologies={["Next.js", "TypeScript", "Tailwind CSS", "Sanity", "Prisma", "PostgreSQL", "NextAuth.js"]}
    title="Technology Stack"
  />

  ## Process

  - Whiteboard/paper prototyping
  - Lofi/Hifi prototypes with Figma
  - Technical implementation and iterations

  <MDXImageFillAspectRatio 
    src="/projects/purdue-hackers/invitation.webp" 
    alt="Invitation" 
    preset="project-documentation"
  />

  ## Pages

  We went for a Neobrutalist Retro UI aesthetic 
  (High contrast, draggable windows, fun/unique graphics and interactions)

  - Hero 
  - Welcome email message, 
  -- Interactive email component (secret messages)
  - Hack Night 
  -- Previous events, secret windows, (broken) hack night countdown
  -- Moon spray effect 
  - CTA
  -- Sad plant, shitty drawings I drew in Figma that were supposed to be just placeholders

  ## What I learned???
  - 

  ## Impact

  The landing page serves as a crucial touchpoint for the Purdue Hackers community, helping to grow membership and showcase the organization's impact on campus.

  ## Next steps
  - Club is constantly growing and evolving, website should change in stride to reflect club's identity
