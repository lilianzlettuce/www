            The relationship to one's own body is a strange and unsettling one. At the most basic level, the body is our only interface to the outside world. Yet it so often lies. Sensory inputs hallucinate, biological systems fail—we deceive ourselves: there is no objective way to experience what’s around us. Our bodies and our senses are unreliable narrators, yet they are the only things we can rely on, in a brutally and beautifully ironic way. 

            In this work I explore the body as an imperfect vessel. Using frames of my own body integrated with still images of existing artwork, I examine corporal-spiritual relationships and illuminate unexpected forms that clash and meld into something new. Embodied images form disembodied identities using digital projections of flesh. The organic reinvents itself as a machine. Form is sculpted and manipulated through dismembered body parts—hands floating in space, headless torsos. Growing, ripping, coming apart. At what point does your body stop being you?

            These video elements investigate and interact with avant garde works of various movements and mediums, from the expressive wood carving in Ernst Ludwig Kirchner's Dancer with Necklace to abstraction that strips away all natural forms in Piet Mondrian's Composition in White, Red, and Yellow. They interact with both structural and conceptual elements of underlying artworks, playing with overlapping forms through the addition of movement and color. The grainy textures and pixelated glitches exemplify how different aspects of the body can merge and conflate to become (or revert to) nothing more than flesh.
