    ###### Background
  </SectionColumn>
  <SectionColumn size={12}>
    #### Scout is a YC-backed startup building an AI-powered student information system to automate administrative tasks for schools.

    The company had recently pivoted, and wanted a custom-coded landing page to launch their product.
    Given existing UI prototypes from a designer, I was tasked with building the site from scratch. 
    The implementation focused on delivering a seamless user experience with modern animations and responsive design.

    <br/><br/><br/>

    #### The Challenge

    The existing landing page featured the most up-to-date information on product details, but was built using stock graphics on a site-builder. 
    Conversely, the new UI prototypes provided by the designer did not effectively convey the most updated content.

    <br/><br/><br/>

    #### Goals
    <ProjectListItem>
      Build a new site landing page that reflects Scoutâ€™s playful visual identity while effectively communicating what the company does
    </ProjectListItem>

    <ProjectListItem>
      Incorporate and build on existing designs, taking creative liberties to implement new content in the same design language
    </ProjectListItem>

    <ProjectListItem>
      Create new components, interactions, and animations while maintaining visual cohesion to create a seamless user experience

    ###### Implementation
  </SectionColumn>
  <SectionColumn size={12}>
    #### Custom-coded Site

    We decided on a modern Next.js/React/Typescript stack for its scalability and performance. 
    The site takes advantage of reusable components, server-side rendering, and static-site generation.

    Implementing this architecture required careful consideration of how to properly use SSR and manage side-effects within the render cycle. I had to balance managing state for animations on the client side while maintaining the benefits of server-side rendering, ensuring the site delivered both performance and rich interactive elements.

    <br/><br/>

    #### Elevating UX and Interactions

    I created interactive components to showcase Scout's features, including animated cards and dynamic content sections that engage users as they scroll through the page.

    Themed micro-animations for buttons, page sections, and other UI elements help reinforce Scout's playful brand identity while maintaining professional functionality.

    #### Blog Integration
    
    I integrated Sanity CMS so the team can easily publish blog posts without touching the source code. This involved writing custom queries for fetching post metadata and content, and defining schemas and types for post data structures.

    Working with strict typing in TypeScript required careful type definitions for the CMS data, and I had to find creative workarounds for complex nested content structures while maintaining type safety throughout the integration.

    ###### Results

  <SectionColumn size={12}>
    #### Performance and SEO
    
    The implementation leverages Next.js's built-in optimizations for fast loading times and excellent SEO performance. Server-side rendering ensures content is immediately available to users and search engines, while static generation provides optimal performance for the marketing content.

      className="w-full my-10"
    />

    <br/><br/>

    #### Accessible and Mobile-Friendly
    
    I ensured delightful UI/UX across all devices with responsive resizing and cross-platform compatibility. The site features a mobile-first design approach with smooth animations that work consistently across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
