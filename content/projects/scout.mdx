    #### Scout is a YC-backed startup building an AI-powered student information system to automate administrative tasks for schools.

    <div className="text-lg">
      The company had recently pivoted, and decided they wanted a custom-coded landing page to replace their Wordpress site.

      Given existing UI prototypes from a designer, I was tasked with building a landing page from scratch. 
      The implementation focused on delivering a seamless user experience with modern animations and responsive design.
    </div>

    <br/><br/><br/>

    #### The Challenge
    The previous landing page featured the most up-to-date content about the company, but was built using stock graphics on a site-builder. 
    Conversely, the new UI prototypes provided by the designer did not entirely cover the most updated content.

    <br/><br/><br/>

    #### Goals
    → Build a new site landing page that reflects Scout’s playful visual identity while effectively communicating what the company does
    
    → Incorporate existing designs, taking creative liberties to implement new content in the same design language
    
    → Create new components, interactions, and assets to create a seamless user experience while maintaining visual cohesion

    ###### Implementation

  <SectionColumn size={12}>
    #### Custom-coded Site

    We decided on a modern Next.js/React/Typescript stack for its scalability and performance. 
    The site takes advantage of reusable components, server-side rendering, and static-site generation.

    Interactions and animations to improve the user experience 
    Challenges:
    Figuring out how to properly use SSR, putting side-effects directly in the render, not being able to use state or hooks
    Managing state for animations on the client side

    <br/><br/><br/>

    #### Elevating UX and Interactions

    Interactive components to showcase Scout’s features

    Themed micro-animations for buttons, page sections, etc.

    <br/><br/><br/>

    #### Blog Integration
    Integrated Sanity CMS so the team can easily publish blog posts without touching the source code.


    Wrote queries for fetching post metadata and content, 
    Defined “schemas/types” for post data structures

    Challenges with strict typing in Typescript, had to find workaround

    <br/><br/><br/>

    #### Accessible and Mobile-Friendly
    Ensured delightful UI/UX across all devices with responsive resizing and cross-platform compatibility.
