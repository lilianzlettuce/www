    ### Background
  </SectionColumn>
  <SectionColumn size={3}>
    #### Scout is a YC-backed startup building an AI-powered student information system to automate administrative tasks for schools.

    Scout is an AI-powered student information system that helps schools run more efficiently, so teachers can spend less time on administrative tasks and more time connecting with their students.
    
    The company had recently pivoted, and decided they wanted a custom-coded landing page.

    I was given:
    - Existing UI prototypes from a designer
    - Existing site created using Wordpress 
  </SectionColumn>

  <SectionColumn size={2}>
    ### Problem
  </SectionColumn>
  <SectionColumn size={3}>
    The current landing page featured the most up-to-date content about the company, but was built using stock graphics on a site-builder. 
    Conversely, the new UI prototypes provided by the designer did not entirely cover the most updated content.

    ## Goals

  <SectionColumn size={3}>
    → Build a new site landing page that reflects Scout’s playful visual identity while effectively communicating what the company does→ Incorporate existing designs, taking creative liberties to implement new content in the same design language
    
    → Create new components, interactions, and assets that fit existing design language
    
    → Maintain visual cohesion

## Implementation 
### Custom-coded Site

We decided on a modern Next.js/React/Typescript stack for its scalability and performance. 
The site takes advantage of reusable components, server-side rendering, and --static-site generation--.


Interactions and animations to improve the user experience 
Challenges:
Figuring out how to properly use SSR, putting side-effects directly in the render, not being able to use state or hooks
Managing state for animations on the client side


### Expanding on design language... UX? Interactions
### Elevating UX

Interactive components to showcase Scout’s features

Themed micro-animations for buttons, page sections, etc.

### Blog Integration
Integrated Sanity CMS so the team can easily publish blog posts without touching the source code.


Wrote queries for fetching post metadata and content, 
Defined “schemas/types” for post data structures

Challenges with strict typing in Typescript, had to find workaround

### Accessible and Mobile-Friendly
Ensured delightful UI/UX across all devices with responsive resizing and cross-platform compatibility.


## Key Features

- **Modern Tech Stack**: Next.js with TypeScript for robust development
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for all device sizes
- **Smooth Animations**: Enhanced user experience with thoughtful motion design
- **Performance Optimized**: Fast loading times and smooth interactions
- **Design System**: Consistent visual language throughout
